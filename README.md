# AR-Model-Visualizer
This project is part of the "Practical Augmented Reality" course at LMU. It serves as an introduction to augmented reality (AR). The project involves creating an AR application using Unity and Vuforia. This application displays a Sketchfab model via a QR code, enabling rotation, translation, and appearance modification of the displayed model based on user input.
