# AR-Model-Visualizer
This project is part of the "Practical Augmented Reality" course at LMU. It serves as an introduction to augmented reality (AR). The project involves creating an AR application using Unity and Vuforia. This application allows users to place a Sketchfab model on a QR code and interact with it by rotating, translating, and changing the color of the object.
